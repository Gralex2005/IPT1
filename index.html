      <p>I was born on January 19, 2005, at Bacnotan District Hospital. My early childhood was spent in Sto. Rosario, San Juan, La Union, where I lived for a short period before my family decided to move to the mountainous area of San Gabriel, La Union. It was in San Gabriel where I spent almost twelve years of my life, completing my elementary education. I have fond memories of my childhood there, playing with friends, exploring the vast greenery, and enjoying the scenic beauty of the mountains. The fresh air, the simplicity of life, and the close-knit community made my childhood truly special.</p>

      <p>However, after graduating from elementary school, my mother took me back to San Juan so I could continue my high school education. This was an exciting yet daunting transition for me, as I had to leave behind the familiar surroundings and friends I had grown up with.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, circumstances changed, and I was forced to return to San Gabriel to take care of my grandparents. It was a difficult transition, as I had to balance my studies with household responsibilities. My days were filled with taking care of my grandparents, helping with household chores, and ensuring I kept up with my schoolwork. Despite the challenges, I remained committed to my studies and persevered through the difficulties. I completed Grades 9 and 10 during this time.</p>

      <p>After the passing of my grandfather, I returned to San Juan to pursue my senior high school education. It was not easy to readjust to a new school environment, but I persevered and eventually graduated from San Juan Senior High School.

    <h2>Tertiary Education</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>With high school behind me, I had to make an important decision regarding my tertiary education. Initially, I considered enrolling at Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University (DMMMSU) to pursue a degree in Information Technology. However, after weighing my options and discussing with my family, they decided that Lorma Colleges would be the better choice due to its proximity to our home, making it more convenient for me to travel.</p>
      <p>Now, I am in my second year at Lorma Colleges, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. The journey has not been easy, but my passion for technology drives me to keep pushing forward. I remain dedicated to my studies and am determined to complete my course successfully. The curriculum has been both challenging and rewarding, allowing me to develop skills in programming, networking, and data management.</p>

The faculty and staff have been supportive, providing guidance and encouragement whenever I faced difficulties.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, I aim to gain practical experience through internships and part-time work to further enhance my skills and prepare myself for the competitive job market. I am also considering pursuing further studies or certifications to stay updated with the rapidly evolving technology landscape. My goal is to specialize in areas such as software development or cybersecurity, fields that greatly interest me.</p>
